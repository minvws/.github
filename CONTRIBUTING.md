# Contributing
 
## Code of Conduct
 
All members of the project community must abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/minvws/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Only by respecting each other we can develop a productive, collaborative community.
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by filing a complaint at https://www.government.nl/contact/making-a-complaint and/or contacting a project maintainer. 
 
We appreciate your courtesy of avoiding political questions here. Issues which are not related to the project itself will be closed by our community managers. 
 
## Engaging in Our Project
 
We use GitHub to manage reviews of pull requests.
 
* If you are a new contributor, see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)
 
* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing (with `@...`) a suitable maintainer of this repository in the description of the pull request.
 
* If you plan to do something more involved, please reach out to us via Slack at praatmee.codefor.nl. This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration.

 
## Steps to Contribute
 
Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from other contributors on the same issue.
 
If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them, and one of the maintainers will clarify.
 
## Contributing Code or Documentation
 
You are welcome to contribute code or documentation. Please read and sign the [Contributer License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/minvws/nl-covid19-notification-app-coordination/blob/master/CLA.md) before contributing. 
 
## Pull Request Checklist
 
* Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master, you may be asked to rebase your changes.
 
* Commits should be as small as possible while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* ensure you sign your commits (`git commit -S -m "commit commentary`), see also [Github signing commits](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/signing-commits). 

* Test your changes as thoroughly as possible before you commit them. Preferably, automate your test by unit/integration tests. If tested manually, provide information about the test scope in the PR description (e.g. “Test passed: Upgrade version from 0.42 to 0.42.23.”).
 
* Create _Work In Progress [WIP]_ pull requests only if you need clarification or an explicit review before you can continue your work item.
 
* Post review:
  * If a review requires you to change your commit(s), please test the changes again.
  * Amend the affected commit(s) and force push onto your branch.
  * Set respective comments in your GitHub review to resolved.
  * Create a general PR comment to notify the reviewers that your amendments are ready for another round of review.
 
## Issues and Planning
 
* We use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancement requests. 
 
* Please provide as much context as possible when you open an issue. The information you provide must be comprehensive enough to reproduce that issue for the assignee. Therefore, contributors should use but aren't restricted to the issue template provided by the project maintainers.
 
* When creating an issue, try using one of our issue templates which already contain some guidelines on which content is expected to process the issue most efficiently. If no template applies, you can of course also create an issue from scratch.
 
* Please apply one or more applicable labels to your issue so that all community members are able to cluster the issues better.
